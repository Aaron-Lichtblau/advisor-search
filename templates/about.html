             <h4>Our Mission:</h4>
             <p>Every year Princeton juniors and seniors in the COS department face the daunting task of finding an advisor to work with on their independent work and thesis. As the capstone projects of their Princeton careers, independent work and the senior thesis are the most important projects that they will have ever worked on. Oftentimes the relationship with their faculty advisor will determine how well the project goes, as well as potential future collaboration and recommendation. Thus, finding an advisor who is a good match, is one of the most important jobs for upperclassmen.</p>
             <p>We aim to ease this stressful process by matching students with advisors based on areas of research. By connecting students with advisors, we hope to become the go-to resource on searching for facultyâ€™s research.</p>
             <p>This website was developed as a COS333 project in the fall of 2019.</p>
