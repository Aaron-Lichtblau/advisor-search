      <h3>Getting Started</h3>

      <p>It is best to get started with finding your advisor as early as possible. Once you have found a professor, whose current or past work excites you, go ahead and send a brief email expressing your interest in being their advisee. Here is an example email for you to build off of:</p>
      <p>Dear Professor _______,</p>
      <p>I am a junior/senior in the ______ department and I have been looking into areas of research as areas of research that I may pursue in my IW/Thesis. Your work in these fields has caught my eye, and I would like to be your advisee for my IW/Thesis. Specifically, I find your work on current/past project to be an exciting example that I can work from.</p>
      <p>Please let me know if you are open to discuss being my IW/Thesis advisor further.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>__________</p>
