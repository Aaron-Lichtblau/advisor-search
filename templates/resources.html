      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <br>
      <p>It is best to get started with finding your advisor as early as possible. Once you have found a professor whose work excites you, go ahead and send an email expressing your interest in being their advisee. Here is an example email for you to build off:</p>
      <br>
      <p>Dear Professor _______,</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am a junior/senior in the Computer Science department and I am exploring areas of research to do my thesis/IW work. In this search process, I reviewed past theses/IW projects in AreasOfReasearch: _______. One paper that fascinated me was (Title of Project) by (author of IW/thesis name).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Specificallyâ€¦ in this section, discuss something that you found exciting in the field of computer science, that was in this paper. Feel free to talk personally, about why you want to work in this area.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Your work in these fields has made me want to be your advisee for my IW/Thesis. Please let me know if you are open to discuss being my IW/Thesis advisor further.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>The Great Dondini</p>

      <h3>Funding Options</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Your Independent Work of Thesis may require expensive tools. But it is not your job to purchase them. The University encourages students to apply for funding through a variety of grants. Below, you will find a few places to search for funding. However, if you are unsuccessful in finding a grant to apply for, do not hesitate to reach out to Mikki Hornstein for advice. </p>
      <br>
      <p>This is the current SEAS funding application. Be sure to look it over and know what to expect when applying for funding.</p>
